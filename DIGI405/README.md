# Course Description | Whakamahuki

This course examines computer-aided methods used in digital humanities and the social sciences for analysing discourses, an object of study that draws together multiple ways that language reflects and shapes social meanings. Within this context, it introduces concepts and methods for analysing natural language data and applies these through a series of practical lab classes. The first part of the course focuses on classic discourse analysis methods drawn from corpus linguistics, as well as the essential preprocessing steps used to prepare texts for a range of analytical purposes. In the second part of the course we study topic modeling, a technique for unsupervised, exploratory data analysis that has been widely used in digital humanities, and, finally, consider text classification methods to identify discursive attributes such as sentiment, genre, or style.

Throughout the course we will examine the complexities of analysing texts, discourses and data at different scales. To avoid uncritically adopting the metaphor of ‘text mining’, we direct our attention to the wider methodological and interpretative issues involved and identify ethical and political dimensions to our analysis. We will read, analyse and discuss a broad selection of material, including fiction, non-fiction, and social media texts, and reflect on the knowledge claims that may be made when texts and discourses become data.
