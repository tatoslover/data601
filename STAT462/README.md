# Data Mining

## Course Description | Whakamahuki

STAT462 is a course in statistical learning and data mining, suited to anyone with an
interest in analysing data. The course will introduce a variety of statistical learning and data mining
techniques for supervised and unsupervised learning problems. A range of methods for classification,
regression, clustering and association purposes will be introduced, including decision trees, random
forests, the Apriori algorithm and support vector machines. The lectures will be supplemented with
laboratory sessions using the statistical software package R.

## Learning Outcomes | Hua Akoranga

The course will:

- Introduce statistical learning and data mining;
- Introduce data analysis techniques for regression, classification, cluster analysis and association analysis; and
