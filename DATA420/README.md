# Scalable Data Science

## Course Description | Whakamahuki

This is a very practical course, with students learning by experimenting on cloud-based clusters with large datasets.

This course will introduce students to topics in scalable data science based on distributed computing techniques. We will look at principles of distributed computing, topics in statistical modelling, and applications of distributed machine learning to find scalable solutions for real problems. This is a very practical course, and students will learn by experimenting on both university and cloud based clusters with large datasets. All computing resources are available online using remote desktop and there will be interactive computer labs online for students who are not on campus. Enrolled students who take this course will have ongoing access to computing resources to pursue additional projects.

The intent of the course is to provide an environment that is very similar to what you will experience in a data science position in industry. You will need to understand the theory underlying common solutions to data science problems and how to implement these using a distributed computing framework such as Spark.
