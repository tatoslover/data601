# Data Science in Industry

## Course Description | Whakamahuki

This course is heavily focused on the “applied” side of data science rather than the theoretical. We will use R as the language of choice. Much of the material involving R and shiny will involve a degree of self learning.

## Learning Outcomes | Hua Akoranga

There is an emphasis on three main themes.

1. Best statistical practise

We will progressively look at each stage of analysing data and producing a model of it. Best practise is mainly about doing the right things in the order right. In particular we look at the vexing issue of “data leakage.”

2. Communication through visualisation

We will employ “Shiny” to visualise our data science. Shiny is built upon R and enables you to write an interactive web page employing dynamic visualisations. This is a great way to “sell” your work to your “clients” through a clear message that non-technical decision makers can relate to.

3. Problems typical of the real world

Real life data is not like the numerous data sets that are available in the public domain. Real life data sets are messy; they have: missing data, useless variables, outliers, measurement uncertainty, correlation, non-independent observations, imbalanced categories etc. At each stage we will define strategies for dealing with these issues.
