# Computer Programming

## Course Description | Whakamahuki

An introduction for graduate students to imperative computer programming using Python. Topics include: expressions, assignment, selection and iteration, structured data (lists, dictionaries, tuples, arrays), functional decomposition, file processing, using library code, and an introduction to object-oriented programming. Students must develop a significant piece of program code in a project that demonstrates mastery of programming for practical applications, typically in data science.

## Learning Outcomes | Hua Akoranga

- Fluently solve simple programming problems with a given programming language.
- Analyse programming code to predict program behaviour.  
- Employ appropriate third-party programming libraries to deal with complex programming problems.  
- Develop a program to cleanse data, including organising, identify trends and visualise data for ill-specified, complex data-science problems.

## Syllabus/Topics

This is an accelerated course aimed at graduate students without any prior programming background. It introduces the concepts of imperative programming, using Python, to develop programming skills aimed at data science-centred problems.

Learners will develop their skills throughout the course through a project that involves data cleansing, data analysis and visualisation. Topics covered throughout the course to support the completion of this project include:
- Expressions
- Assignment
- Selection and iteration
- Structured data (lists, dictionaries, tuples, arrays)
- Functional decomposition
- Object-oriented programming
- Data manipulation using Pandas
- Visualisation with matplotlib
